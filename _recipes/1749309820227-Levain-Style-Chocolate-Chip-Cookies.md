2. Roughly chop the dark chocolate.

3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the cake flour, all-purpose flour, kosher salt, corn starch, and baking soda.

5. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the egg yolks, until smooth.

6. Switch to the paddle attachment and mix in the dry ingredients until well combined.

7. Fold in the chopped walnuts and chocolate until evenly distributed.

10. Bake in a preheated oven at 425°F (220°C) for 10-13 minutes, or until golden brown.

11. Allow the cookies to cool on a wire rack before serving.
