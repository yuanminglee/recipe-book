1. In a medium saucepan, melt the unsalted butter and set aside to cool.

2. Roughly chop the dark chocolate.

3. In a medium bowl, combine cake flour, all-purpose flour, kosher salt, corn starch, and baking soda. Whisk together.

4. Using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine brown sugar and granulated sugar. Whisk on medium speed, then slowly add the melted butter.

5. Once combined, add the eggs one at a time, followed by the egg yolks. Mix until smooth.

6. Switch to the paddle attachment and gradually mix in the flour mixture until smooth.

7. Fold in the chopped walnuts and chocolate until well combined.

8. Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes.

9. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

10. Weigh out dough balls to 6oz each and place on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each cookie.

11. Bake for 10-13 minutes, or until golden brown on the edges.

12. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
