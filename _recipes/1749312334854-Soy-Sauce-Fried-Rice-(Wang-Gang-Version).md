1. Soak the pickled mustard tuber in clean water for about 10 minutes to save time. If using pickled vegetables or radish, you can skip this step.

2. Sprinkle a small amount of salt and starch over the leftover cold rice and mix well to absorb excess moisture.

3. Cut the scallions into small pieces and set aside.

4. Separate the egg yolks and whites, and beat each separately in the same direction until well-mixed.

5. Once the pickled mustard tuber has soaked, squeeze out the water and cut it into small cubes.

6. Heat a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add oil and let it heat to 70% of its smoking point. Pour in the egg whites and fry until fragrant, then remove and set aside.

7. Add more oil to the wok and let it heat to 40% of its smoking point. Pour in the egg yolks and fry until fragrant.

8. Add the pickled mustard tuber and stir-fry until well combined with the egg yolks. Then add the previously fried egg whites and mix well.

9. Once the pickled mustard tuber is lightly browned, add the prepared cold rice. Drizzle oil around the edges of the wok to help the rice heat up quickly. Stir-fry the rice on high heat for the best results.

10. Add two tablespoons of soy sauce and continue stir-frying. Stir-fry for a few more minutes until the rice grains start to pop. Sprinkle the chopped scallions on top and stir-fry for a few more seconds.

11. Remove from the wok and serve.
