## Instructions

1. Blend ginger, garlic, coriander seeds, Madras curry powder, Kashmiri chilli, and other spices with water & oil to form a thick paste.

2. Combine beef with half of the spice blend in a bowl. Ensure the beef is thoroughly coated. Preheat oven to 250°C (482°F). Spread the marinated beef on a baking tray and cook until it achieves a caramelised exterior, about 20-30 minutes.

3. In a large pan, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they turn dark and caramelised, about 25 minutes.

4. While onions are caramelising, rinse basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.

5. Fry finely sliced onions until crispy.

6. Combine the beef and onions with the remaining spice blend in the pan. Cook for a few minutes, then add beef stock. Simmer on low heat for 2 hours.

7. In a separate deep cooking pot, lightly toast whole spices (star anise, cloves, cardamom pods) in a bit of oil for 1-2 minutes on medium heat.

8. Layer the curry mix, rice, and saffron-infused milk in the pot. Add a layer of fried onions. Repeat until the pot is almost full, leaving space for rice expansion.

9. Cover the pot with foil and a lid. Bake in a preheated oven at 160°C (320°F) for 1 hour 40 minutes.

10. Let the biryani rest, covered, for 20 minutes after baking. Remove lid and foil carefully to allow steam to escape.

11. Garnish with crispy onions and freshly chopped coriander before serving.
