## Instructions

1. Blend ginger, garlic, coriander seeds, Madras curry powder, Kashmiri chili, and other spices with water & oil to form a thick paste.

2. Combine your beef with half of the spice blend (ginger, garlic, coriander seeds, curry powders, etc.) in a bowl. Ensure the beef is thoroughly coated. Preheat your oven to a high temperature (250°C or 482°F). Spread the marinated beef on a baking tray and cook until it achieves a caramelised exterior, mimicking the effect of a tandoor oven. This should take approximately 20-30 minutes, depending on the size of the beef pieces.

3. In a large pan, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they turn dark and caramelised. This process might take up to 25 minutes.

4. While onions are caramelising, rinse basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This process may take several minutes of continuous rinsing.

5. Fry finely sliced onions until crispy.

6. Combine the beef and onions with excess spice blend in the pan. Allow to cook through for a few minutes before adding beef stock. Allow the sauce to cook on a low heat for roughly 2 hours.

7. In a separate deep cooking pot, start by lightly toasting whole spices (star anise, cloves, cardamom pods) in a bit of oil to release their flavours. This should take about 1-2 minutes on medium heat.

8. Add a layer of the curry mix to the pan. Follow with a layer of rice. Spread the rice evenly over the beef. Drizzle the saffron-infused milk evenly over the rice. Add a layer of the fried onions over the rice. Repeat until the mix almost fills the pan, allowing space for the rice to expand.

9. Cover the pot with foil to seal in the moisture, then place the lid on top. Bake in a preheated oven at 160°C (320°F) for about 1 hour and 40 minutes. This slow cooking process helps the biryani to stew and steam, ensuring each grain of rice is infused with flavour.

10. After baking, remove the biryani from the oven and let it rest, covered, for about 20 minutes. This allows the steam to continue cooking the rice to perfection. Carefully remove the lid and foil, allowing any excess steam to escape.

11. Garnish the biryani with additional crispy onions and freshly chopped coriander for added texture and flavour before serving.
