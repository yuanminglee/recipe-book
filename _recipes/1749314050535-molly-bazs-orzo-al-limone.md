## Ingredients
- 1 medium yellow onion, finely diced
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced
- 5 tablespoons (75g) unsalted butter (or salted butter)
- 3/4 cup (85g) Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish
- 1 cup (150g) orzo
- Salt to taste
- Freshly cracked black pepper to taste
- Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling

## Instructions

1. **Prep your aromatics**: Finely dice the yellow onion and set aside. Using a vegetable peeler, peel 3 (3-inch long) strips of lemon zest from the lemon and set aside.

2. **Start the orzo**: In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat until melted and foamy. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring often, until softened but not browned, about 5-7 minutes.

3. **Toast the orzo**: Add the orzo, lemon zest, and freshly cracked black pepper. Stir to toast for 2 minutes.

4. **Cook the orzo**: Stir in 2-2.5 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the water is absorbed, about 6-8 minutes. The orzo should be al dente.

5. **Finish the orzo**: Remove the pot from heat. Stir in 2 tablespoons butter and Parmesan cheese. Grate the remaining lemon zest into the pot. Squeeze the juice from both halves of the lemon into the orzo. Taste and adjust salt as needed. Add a few tablespoons of water if needed to achieve a creamy consistency.

6. **Serve**: Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, season with more black pepper, and top with additional grated Parmesan cheese.
