1. Melt the unsalted butter in a medium saucepan and set aside to cool slightly.

2. Roughly chop the dark chocolate into chunks.

3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the cake flour, all-purpose flour, kosher salt, corn starch, and baking soda.

4. Using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the brown sugar and white granulated sugar. Whisk on medium speed, then slowly pour in the melted butter.

5. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the egg yolks, mixing until smooth.

6. Switch to the paddle attachment and gradually mix in the dry ingredients until just combined.

7. Fold in the chopped walnuts and dark chocolate chunks until evenly distributed.

8. Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes.

9. Preheat the oven to 425째F (220째C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

10. Scoop the dough into 6oz balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving ample space between each cookie.

11. Bake for 10-13 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.

12. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
