1. Heat a skillet or wok over high heat and add sesame oil. Once hot, add ginger strips and stir-fry until light brown and aromatic.

2. Add chicken and stir-fry for 10-15 seconds, then add soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and ground white pepper.

3. Add water, stir quickly, cover the skillet or wok, and reduce heat to low. Let simmer for 10 minutes, or until sauce thickens and chicken is tender.

4. Dish out and serve immediately.
