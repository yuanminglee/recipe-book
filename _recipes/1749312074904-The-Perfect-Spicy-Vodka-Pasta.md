1. Fill a 6-quart pot halfway with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Season the water with salt until it is almost as salty as the ocean.

2. In a 5-quart sauté pan, add the olive oil and guanciale. Set the heat to medium-low and stir often until the guanciale is crispy and browned, about 4-5 minutes.

3. Increase the heat to medium, then add the Fresno chilies and garlic. Season with a pinch of salt and sauté until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute.

4. Stir in the sugar, then add the gochujang and tomato paste. Cook, stirring often, for 2-3 minutes, or until the mixture begins to thicken and caramelize.

5. Add your pasta to the boiling water and cook according to package directions if using store-bought, until al dente. If using fresh pasta, cook for 2-3 minutes or until al dente.

6. Deglaze the sauce with the vodka and water, stirring with a wooden or heat-proof spoon or spatula to scrape the bottom of the pan.

7. Add the heavy cream, bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1-2 minutes.

8. Once the sauce is done, taste for salt and add more if needed.

9. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce pot and toss to combine. Cut off the heat and vigorously stir in the grated pecorino and butter. Add additional pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to aid in emulsification as needed.

10. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed, then serve in bowls or on plates. Top with freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano or more pecorino, and finish with a little fresh cracked black pepper.

**Optional Homemade Pasta:**
- Combine the semolina and water in a large mixing bowl. Stir together with your hands until it just comes together.
- Knead until it forms into a cohesive ball. Add a tablespoon or so of water as needed to help it come together.
- Set up a baking sheet lined with semolina-dusted parchment paper. Attach the KitchenAid rigatoni-shaped pasta extruder to your stand mixer. Feed small balls of dough through the machine at speed 6, pressing and cutting to desired length (about 2”/5cm). Repeat with the rest of the dough, toss with more semolina, then dry uncovered overnight in the fridge.
