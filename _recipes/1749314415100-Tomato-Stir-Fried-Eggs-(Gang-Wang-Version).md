1. Wash the tomatoes, remove the stems, and cut them into chunks using a rolling knife technique.

2. Beat the eggs in a bowl, add a small amount of salt and 1g of white vinegar (to remove the fishy smell). You can also add a little wine to the eggs if desired.

3. Heat a pan with oil over medium heat. When the oil reaches 40% heat, pour in the egg mixture. Cook on low heat for 1 minute until the eggs are set. Flip the eggs halfway through cooking to ensure even cooking, then break them into pieces and set aside.

4. Add a small amount of oil to the pan, then add the tomatoes and stir-fry over low heat. Add the tomato paste (to enhance the tomato flavor), stir well, and add some water. Simmer for 1 minute. Start seasoning with 1g of salt and 1g of white sugar (to balance the acidity). Once the tomatoes are soft, add an appropriate amount of cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce. Stir in a little vegetable oil, add the eggs, and stir-fry everything together before serving.
